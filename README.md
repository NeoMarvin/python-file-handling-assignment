# 📂 File Handling & Exception Handling Assignment  

## 📌 Description  
This project is part of my Python learning module on **File Handling and Exception Handling**.  
It includes two main tasks:  
1. **File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️** – A program that reads from a file, modifies the content, and writes it to a new file.  
2. **Error Handling Lab 🧪** – A program that asks the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.
